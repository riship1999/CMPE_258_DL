# Deep Learning Assignment - README

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of a 3-layer deep neural network for nonlinear regression using various frameworks, including NumPy, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and TensorFlow Lite. The assignment emphasizes building the networks from scratch where applicable, avoiding built-in layers where required, and using advanced tensor operations such as `einsum` instead of matrix multiplication. Additionally, all implementations are accompanied by explanations of the code and results.

## Repository Structure

The repository includes multiple Colab notebooks, each implementing a different variant of the deep neural network:
