# Tensor Operations and Einsum Exploration

## Overview
This assignment explores fundamental tensor operations crucial to understanding and excelling in deep learning. The assignment is divided into two separate Google Colab notebooks:

1. **Tensor Operations with TensorFlow (einsum operations)**
2. **Tensor Operations with PyTorch**

Each notebook thoroughly demonstrates various tensor operations, highlighting both commonly used and more advanced techniques, including less frequently explored functionalities.
