# Deep Learning Assignment

This repository contains three deep learning models implemented in three separate Google Colab notebooks:

1. **Classification**
2. **Regression**
3. **Image Classification**

Each notebook follows best practices for deep learning model development, including thorough documentation, visualizations, and integration with **Weights & Biases (preferred) or TensorBoard**.

## ðŸ“Œ **Contents**

Each Colab notebook contains the following:

- **Dataset Selection & Preprocessing**
- **Model Architecture & Training**
- **Performance Metrics & Evaluation**
- **Model Visualizations & Training History**
- **Error Analysis & Per-Class Metrics**
- **Integration with Weights & Biases / TensorBoard**
- **Final Artifacts & Outputs**

## ðŸ“Š **Artifacts & Outputs**

Each notebook generates the following artifacts:

- **Trained model weights & checkpoints**
- **Performance metrics (accuracy, loss, precision, recall, F1-score, MAE, etc.)**
- **Visualization plots (loss curves, ROC, PR curves, confusion matrix, etc.)**
- **Per-class error analysis and examples**
- **Integration with Weights & Biases or TensorBoard for tracking**
